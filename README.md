# LaTeX-Template
A general collection of templates for writing technical reports in LaTeX

The premise is simple, LaTeX is a powerful language, and can be used in many ways.  Here are some templates that I have developed over the years that help me to write reports, documents, meeting minutes etc.  If you find any issues please use the issue tracker help me to fix it!

Master is kept clean, and changes are brought in through pull requests from forks or branches

Everyone is welcome to help me improve the template, raise issues using the Issues tab, help write the wiki, or fork the repo and make your own changes to be pulled back in!  Sharing is caring!

Any questions?  Leave me a message on Gitter, or raise an Issue
